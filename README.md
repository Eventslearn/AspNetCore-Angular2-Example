This project would help AspNet developers to jump start with a blank Angular application with login/registration support.

This is forked from the wonderfull work by [chasakell] (https://github.com/chsakell/aspnet5-angular2-typescript)

Features
=======
* Angular PathRoutingStrategy implemted with URL rewrite on server side. This will help to implement server side rendering in future.
* AspNetCore (aka Asp Net 5 or vNext) as server side framework with purely REST services (JSON)
* Angular 2 beta as a pure single page application with static typings using typescript for client side code
